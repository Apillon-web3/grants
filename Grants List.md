## Apillon Web3 Course - Code Snippets

Short description:
Apillon MVP will support 3 infrastructure services, parachains: KILT, CRUST, PHALA. Once the MVP is live we will create a written tutorial accompanied by Code Snippets which will allow users (complete beginners) to develop and deploy their own Web3 project utilising all three before mentioned services in the background. 

Format: 
- Written tutorial + Javascript Code snippets


## Build Web3 Video series + Use case

Short description: 
In this project, we will build NFT marketplace, fully compatible with Apillon and the three underlying services provided in our MVP (KILT, PHALA, CRUST). The NFT Marketplace project will be 1 click deployable on our platform and made available to any user free of charge. 
While building this one click installation package, we will record a step by step Video series course, that takes the user from 0 lines of code to a working NFT marketplace. 

Includes: 
- 1 clic installation NFT Marketplace on Apillon
- Smart contracts automatically deployed on Moonbeam and Astar
- Future seampless upgrades for NFT marketplace
- A full step by step video course with open source code, english voiceover and all the materials needed to build such NFT marketplace


## SDK 
Short description: 
In this project we are going to develop Apillon SDK, allowing for much easier usage of all underlying services. 


## CESS Integration

Short description:
In this project we are going to integrate new service from Polkadot ecosystem to Apillon platform, allowing our users to choose between 2 different types of Web3 Storage (CESS and CRUST). Because CESS and CRUST approach storage with different angles, infrastructure should be agnostic to the details and still provide choices to our developers.
